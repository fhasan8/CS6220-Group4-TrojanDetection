# NeuralCleanse Code
This is the section for NeuralCleanse. 

## Required Other Repositories
We made use of the official NeuralCleanse GitHub Repo: https://github.com/bolunwang/backdoor 
Make sure to download the repo and follow the instructions for setting it up.

We also used onnx-tensorflow: https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow 
We wanted to use this to help us convert our ONNX format models into TensorFlow but we obviously did not have good luck with this last part due to type/versioning conflicts.


Since most of the code for this method is from open-source: 


## Opensource codebase statistics
Backdoor: 1,159 lines, 91.1% Python, 8.9% Markdown

ONNX Tensorflow: 17,288 lines, 91.4% Python, 7.9% Markdown, 0.5% YAML, 0.1% Shell Scripts, 0% Properties (4 lines)
