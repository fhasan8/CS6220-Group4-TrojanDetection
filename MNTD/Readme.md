# MNTD python notebook

MNTD python notebook contains the definition, training, evaluation and analysis code for the MNTD network.

It does expect dataset at a specific location "../../tdc_datasets/detection" for both trojan and clean folders of the dataset.

Multiple MNTD networks were created for experimentation. Some of them are saved in the notebook and can directly to be defined and used for training and evaluation.
The hyperparameters can be updated and the model can be trained in the notebook.

The implementation is taken from the baseline implementation - https://github.com/mmazeika/tdc-starter-kit/blob/main/detection/example_submission.ipynb

The new experimental networks along with the analysis code is separately added in the notebook.

The requriments.txt contains all the packages installed in the conda environment used for training MNTD.
